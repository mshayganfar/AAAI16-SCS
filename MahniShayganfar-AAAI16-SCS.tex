The capability of functional coexistence has the key role in design of
the symbiotic cognitive systems. To obtain this capability, a cognitive system
requires to possess evaluative and communicative processes. Emotions and
their underlying processes provide such functions in social and collaborative
environments. We investigate the mutual influence of affective and collaboration
processes in a cognitive theory to support the interaction between humans and
robots or virtual agents. We develop new algorithms for these processes, as well
as a new overall computational model for implementing collaborative robots and
agents. We build primarily on the \textit{cognitive appraisal} theory of
emotions and the \textit{SharedPlans} theory of collaboration to investigate the
structure, fundamental processes and functions of emotions in a collaboration
context.

Intelligence is a set of mental abilities that enables a human to comprehend,
reason and adapt in the environment, and as a result, act effectively and
purposefully in that environment. Emotions play a crucial role in humans'
explanation of intelligent behaviors. Emotions affect not only what people do,
but also the way they do it \cite{cowie:concepts-definitions}. Ronald De Sousa
in The Rationality of Emotion \cite{sousa:rationality-emotion} makes a good case
for the claim that humans are capable of rationality largely because they are
creatures with emotions. Emotions significantly impact the procedures of action
generation, execution, control, and interpretation \cite{zhu:emotion-action} in
different environments. 

Emotions are conceptualized as ongoing processes rooted in dynamic social
contexts, which can shape both implicit and explicit emotional responses
\cite{parkinson:emotion-social-interaction}. Emotions are dynamic episode that
not only makes changes in cognitive states, but also produces a sequence of
response patterns on body movements, posture, voice and face
\cite{scherer:expression-appraisal}. Emotions typically occur in response to an
event, usually a social event, real, remembered, anticipated, or imagined. They
are associated with distinctive relational meanings
\cite{parkinson:holds-emotion}. These relations can be with the individual's
past experience, the individual's surrounding objects and environment, or the
other individuals with or without mutual beliefs in a dyadic or a group setting.
Emotions are evaluative and responsive patterns that serve the function of
providing appraisal about whether the ongoing event is harmful, threatening or
beneficial for the well-being of an individual \cite{zhu:emotion-action}.
Consequently, reasoning and emotional processes have an integral and a
supportive relationship, rather than an antagonistic and a conflicting one.

The idea of having robots or other intelligent agents living in a human
environment has been a persistent dream from science fiction books to artificial
intelligence and robotics laboratories. However, there are many challenges in
achieving collaboration between robots and humans in the same environment. Some
of these challenges involve physical requirements, some involve cognitive
requirements, and some involve social requirements. Thus far, there has been an
emphasis on the design of robots to deal with the physical requirements. Many
researchers are also working on the cognitive requirements, inspired by a
diverse set of disciplines. As time passes, there is an increasing recognition
of the importance of the social requirements, and how cognitive systems can
include the influence of the others.

\section{Social Functions of Emotions}

Humans are able to communnicate their emotions in a social context. The social
functions of emotions are the reason behind why humans try to communicate their
emotions. Emotions describe interpersonal dynamics in a way that they can
constitute individuals' relationships
\cite{parkinson:emotions-social,tiedens:social-life}. One aspect of expressing
and communicating emotion in a social context is to express one's social motives
and intentions \cite{hess:darwin-emotion}. Another aspect of communicating
emotions is to reveal the underlying mental states of an individual
\cite{parkinson:emotion-communication}. In
(\citeyear{kleef:emotion-regulate-social}) Van Kleef has discussed the idea of
inferential processes with which individuals can infer information about others'
feelings, relational orientations and behavioral intentions based on their
emotional expressions. He also argues that emotional expressions can impact
social interactions by eliciting others' affective responses.

\section{Motivation}

Functionnal coexistence is an important aspect of the symbiotic cognitive
systems in social environments. Collaboration requires coexistence with
the others and describes how a cognitive agent can function in such environment.
Therefore, the ability of collaborating with humans in the same environment is
crucial for cognitive agents. In fact, a cognitive agent's ability to understand
the collaborative environment impact the effectiveness of a collaboration.
Examples of cognitive capabilities that support the effectiveness of
collaboration include: a) perceiving one's own internal states and b)
communicating them, c) coordinating personal and group behaviors, d) identifying
self and mutual interests, e) recognizing the accountability of private and
shared goals, f) selecting appropriate actions with respect to events, and g)
engaging others in collaboration.

We are investigating the cognitive processes involved in a collaboration in the
context of a cognitive architecture. There are several well-developed cognitive
architectures, e.g., Soar \cite{laird:soar} and ACT-R \cite{anderson:act-r},
each with different approaches to defining the basic cognitive and perceptual
operations. There have also been efforts to integrate affect into these
architectures \cite{dancy:actR-physiology-affect,marinier:behavior-emotion}. In
general, however, these cognitive architectures do not focus on processes to
specifically produce emotion-regulated goal-driven collaborative behaviors. At
the same time, existing collaboration theories, e.g., SharedPlans theory
\cite{grosz:plans-discourse}, focus on describing the structure of a
collaboration in terms of fundamental mental states, e.g., mutual beliefs or
intentions. However, they do not describe the associated processes, their
relationships, and their influences on each other. In contrast,
\textit{Affective Motivational Collaboration Theory} deals with the major
processes, including affective and motivational processes, having an impact on
the collaboration structure. This theory is informed by research in psychology
and artificial intelligence. Our contribution, generally speaking, will be to
synthesize prior work on motivation, appraisal and collaboration, and thus to
provide a new theory which describes the prominent emotion-regulated goal-driven
phenomena in a dyadic collaboration.

\section{Affect and Collaboration}

Collaboration is a coordinated activity in which the participants work jointly
to satisfy a shared goal \cite{grosz:plans-discourse}. There are many important
unanswered questions about the involvement of an individual's cognitive
abilities during collaboration. Some of these questions are related to the
dynamics of collaboration, as well as the underlying mechanisms and processes.
For instance, a general mechanism has yet to be developed that allows an agent
to initiate proactive collaborative behaviors when it faces a blocked task.
There is also a lack of a general mechanism that, in the event of a task
failure, allows an agent to consider the collaborator's anticipated mental
states and emotions, while managing its own internal goals and the
collaboration's shared goal. There are also other questions about the components
involved in these processes at the cognitive level, such as the processes that
are involved for evaluative, regulatory or motivative purposes. There has also
not been enough attention on the processes that are involved to maintain the
social aspects of a collaboration.

Emotions have a key role in influencing the cognitive processes involved in
social interaction and collaboration. Emotion processing and decision-making are
integral aspects of daily life and maintain their prominence during social
interaction and collaboration. However, researchers' understanding of the
interaction between emotions and collaborative behaviors is limited. We believe
that the evaluative role of emotions, as a part of cognitive processes, helps an
agent to perform appropriate behaviors during a collaboration. To work jointly
in a coordinated activity, participants (collaborators) act based on their own
understanding of the world and the anticipated mental states of the counterpart;
this understanding is reflected in their collaborative behaviors. Emotions are
pivotal in the collaboration context, since their regulatory and motivational
roles enhance an individual's autonomy and adaptation as well as his/her
coordination and communication competencies in a dynamic, uncertain and
resource-limited environment.

\section{Affective Motivational Collaboration Theory}

We are building Affective Motivational Collaboration Theory on the foundations
of the \textit{SharedPlans} theory of collaboration \cite{grosz:plans-discourse}
and the \textit{cognitive appraisal} theory of emotions
\cite{gratch:domain-independent}. Affective Motivational Collaboration Theory is
about the interpretation and prediction of observable behaviors in a dyadic
collaborative interaction. The theory focuses on the processes regulated by
emotional states. The observable behaviors represent the outcome of reactive and
deliberative processes related to the interpretation of the self's relationship
to the collaborative environment. 

Affective Motivational Collaboration Theory aims to explain both rapid emotional
reactions to events as well as slower, more deliberative responses. The reactive
and deliberative processes are triggered by two types of events:
\textit{external} events, such as the other's \textit{utterances} and
\textit{primitive actions}, and \textit{internal} events, comprising changes in
the self's mental states, such as belief formation and emotional changes.
Affective Motivational Collaboration Theory explains how emotions regulate the
underlying processes when these events occur during collaboration. This theory
elucidates the role of motives as goal-driven emotion-regulated constructs with
which an agent can form new intentions to cope with internal and external
events. Affective Motivational Collaboration Theory explains the functions of
emotions in a dyadic collaboration and show how affective mechanisms can
coordinate social interactions by enabling one to anticipate other's emotions,
beliefs and intentions.

Our focus is on the mechanisms depicted as mental processes in Figure
\ref{fig:cpm} along with the mental states. The \textit{Mental States} includes
self's (robot's) beliefs, intentions, motives, goals and emotion instances as
well as the anticipated Mental States of the other (human). \textit{Beliefs} are
a crucial part of the Mental States. Beliefs can be generated based on whether
they are shared or not between the collaborators. The SharedPlans
\cite{grosz:plans-discourse} theory is the foundation of this view on beliefs in
which for any given proposition the agent may have: a) private beliefs (the
agent believes the human does not know these), b) the inferred beliefs of the
human (the agent believes the human collaborator has these beliefs), and c)
mutual beliefs (the agent believes both the self and the human have these same
beliefs and both of them believe that). Beliefs also can be generated based on
who or what they are about, i.e., beliefs can be about the self, the other, or
they can be about the environment. \textit{Intentions} are mental constructs
directed at future actions. They play an essential role in taking actions
according to the collaboration plan, and behavior selection in the Coping
mechanism. \textit{Motives} are mental constructs which can initiate, direct and
maintain goal-directed behaviors. They are created by the emotion-regulated
Motivation mechanism. Motives can cause the formation of a new intention for the
agent according to: a) its own emotional states (how the agent feels about
something), b) its own private goal (how an action helps the agent to make
progress), c) the collaboration goal (how an action helps to achieve the shared
goal), and d) other's anticipated beliefs (how an action helps the other).
\textit{Goals} help the agent to create and update its collaboration plan
according to the current private and shared goal content and structure. Goals
direct the formation of intentions to take appropriate corresponding actions
during collaboration. Goals also drive the Motivation mechanism to generate
required motive(s) in uncertain or ambiguous situations, e.g., to minimize the
risk of impasse or to reprioritize goals. \textit{Emotions} in Mental States are
emotion instances that are elicited by the Appraisal mechanism.

The \textit{Collaboration} mechanism maintains constraints on actions, including
task states and the ordering of tasks. The Collaboration mechanism constructs a
hierarchy of tasks and also manage and maintain the constraints and other
details of the collaboration specified by the plan. These details include the
\textit{inputs} and \textit{outputs} of individual tasks, the
\textit{preconditions} specifying whether it is appropriate to perform a task,
and the \textit{postconditions} specifying whether a just-completed task was
successful (which can be used as an indication of an impasse or failure).
Collaboration also keeps track of the focus of attention, which determines the
salient objects, properties and relations at each point of the collaboration.
Moreover, Collaboration mechanism has the ability to shift the focus of
attention during the collaboration. The Collaboration mechanism also provides
processes to update and monitor the shared plan.
  
\textit{Appraisal} is a subjective evaluation mechanism based on individual
processes each of which computes the value of the appraisal variables used in
our computational model. The Appraisal mechanism is responsible for evaluating
changes in the self's Mental States, the anticipated Mental States of the other,
and the state of the collaboration environment. The Collaboration mechanism
needs the evaluative assistance of the Appraisal mechanism for various reasons.
The course of a collaboration is based on a full or a partial plan which needs
to be updated as time passes and collaborators achieve, fail at or abandon a
task assigned to them. The failure of a task should not destroy the entire
collaboration. Appraising the environment and the current events helps the agent
to update the collaboration plan and avoid further critical failures during
collaboration. Appraisal also helps the agent to have a better understanding of
the human's behavior by making inferences based on appraisal variables.
Furthermore, in order to collaborate successfully, a collaborator cannot simply
use the plan and reach to the shared goal; there should be an adaptation
mechanism not only for updating the plan but also the underlying Mental States.

The \textit{Coping} mechanism is responsible for interpreting ongoing changes
in the Mental States and adopting the appropriate behavior with respect to these
changes. The Coping mechanism provides the self with different coping strategies
associated with changes in the self's mental states with respect to the state of
the collaboration.

The \textit{Motivation} mechanism closely work with the Appraisal mechanism. The
purpose of this component is to generate new motives. These motives are
generated based on what the agent believes about the environment including self
and the other collaborator and the corresponding appraisals. The agent uses
these motives to achieve a private or shared goal according to new conditions,
to interact better with a human who needs social interactions, or to evaluate
the success of task performances. The Motivation mechanism operates whenever the
self a) requires and intends to take a new action, b) requires a new motive to
overcome an internal impasse in an ongoing task, or c) wants to provide an
external motive to the other based on other's model when the other faces a
problem in a task.

The agent uses the \textit{Theory of Mind} mechanism to infer and attribute
beliefs, intentions, motives and goals to its collaborator based on the user
model it creates and maintains during the course of the collaboration. In
other words, the Theory of Mind mechanism is the mechanism that infers a model
of the other's anticipated mental state. The self progressively updates this
model during the collaboration.

\section{Conclusion}

The capability of functional coexistence is crucial in symbiotic cognitive
systems. The nature of coexistence requires the ability of working together in
the same environment. To successfully work together symbiotic cognitive systems
need to be able a) to communicate and understand social communication, and b) to
collaborate and maintain a collaborative structure. Therefore, the integration
of emotion-regulated processes, e.g., appraisal, and collaboration structure and
its underlying processes can lead us to a more funcatinally capable symbiotic
cognitive system.

Emotions have a crucial role in communicating one's mental state, motivating
one's actions, and evaluating and interpreting their internal states and the
environment. Emotions generally speaking provide a set of intra- and
interpersonal functions which regulate internal processes and the self's
relationship to the other during the collaboration.
Emotions have meanings in a social context which can be interpreted by an
observer. Emotion functions are important because they provide social
characteristics that the self needs to manifest in its collaborative behavior. 

Collaboration is a coordinated social activity in which participants work
together to perform tasks achieving a shared goal. Collaborative behaviors
enable individuals to work together in a shared environment. These behaviors
help an observor to distinguish between collaboration and other social or
group activities. For instance, collaborators need to be able to synchronize
themselves with their partner and collaborative environment with respect to the
state of the shared goal. To generate collaborative behaviors one requires to
include certain computational mechanisms. We are developing a new computational
theory, called Affective Motivational Collaboration Theory, that combines
emotion-based processes, such as appraisal and coping, with collaboration
processes, such as planning, in a single unified framework. Affective
Motivational Collaboration Theory provides emotion-regulated goal-driven
mechanisms (see Figure \ref{fig:cpm}) by which a robot will be able to show
collaborative behaviors.
